	abstract = {The classical monocentric city model suggests that property prices decrease and transport costs rise with distance to the urban centre, implying that employees face a trade-off between long commutes and high housing costs when making location decisions. Accordingly, some commuters might be forced to take on longer commutes due to rising rents in central locations. In this study, we investigate empirically whether the rental differential between employment centres and residential areas predicts changes in average commuting times. To this end, we consider a gravity model of commuting flows for Ireland over 2011–2016. We present results for Ireland and the metropolitan area of Dublin, which constitutes the largest commuting region in Ireland. The results imply that a 10\% rise in rents in employment centres is associated with an up to 0.6 minute rise in one-way daily average commuting times nationally (about 2.2\% of the average commute duration).},

	abstract = {Abstract
            An empirical model of joint decisions of where to live and where to work demonstrates that individuals make residential and job location choices by trading off wages, housing prices, and commuting costs. Wages are higher in metropolitan markets, but housing prices are also higher in urban areas. Consumers can live in lower priced nonmetropolitan houses and still earn urban wages, but they incur commuting costs that increase with distance from the city. Improvements in transportation that lower commuting time will increase nonmetropolitan populations and will increase the number of nonmetropolitan commuters to metropolitan markets. Equal wage growth across labor markets causes a shift in relative population from rural to urban markets, while an equiproportional increase in housing prices causes a population shift toward rural areas.},

	abstract = {Migration has become a prominent research theme in geography and regional science and it has been approached from various methodological angles. Nonetheless, a common missing element in most migration studies is the lack of awareness of the overall network topology, which characterizes migration flows. Although gravity models focus on spatial interaction—in this case migration—between pairs of origins and destinations, they do not provide insights into the topology of a migration network. We employ network analysis to address such systemic research questions, in particular: how centralized or dispersed are migration flows and how does this structure evolve over time? And, how is migration activity clustered between specific countries, and if it is clustered, do such patterns change over time? Going a step further than exploratory network analysis, in this paper we estimate international migration models for OECD countries based on a dual approach: gravity models estimated using conventional econometric approaches such as panel data regressions and network-based regression techniques such as multivariate regression quadratic assignment procedures. The empirical results reveal not only the determinants of international migration among OECD countries, but also the value of blending network analysis with more conventional analytic methods.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the area of geodemographic research through the development of a new and novel ﬂow-based classiﬁcation of commuting for England and Wales. In doing so, it applies an approach to the analysis of commuting in which origin-destination ﬂow-data, collected as part of the 2011 census of England and Wales, are segmented into groups based on shared similarities across multiple demographic and socioeconomic attributes. k-Means clustering was applied to 49 ﬂow-based commuter variables for 513,892 interactions that captured 18.4 million of the 26.5 million workers recorded as part of the 2011 census of England and Wales. The ﬁnal classiﬁcation resulted in an upper-tier of nine ‘Supergroups’ which were subsequently partitioned to derive a lower-tier of 40 ‘Groups’. A nomenclature was developed and associated pen portraits derived to provide basic signposting to the dominant characteristics of each cluster. Analysis of a selection of patterns underlying the ninefold Supergroup conﬁguration revealed a highly variegated structure of commuting in England and Wales. The classiﬁcation has potentially wide-ranging descriptive and analytical applications within research and policy domains and the approach would be equally transferable to other countries and contexts where origin-destination data are disaggregated based on commuter characteristics.},
